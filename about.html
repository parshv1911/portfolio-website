        I'm Parshv Ranpura, a passionate web developer and AI enthusiast. I love
        creating dynamic and responsive web applications that provide seamless user
        experiences. With a strong foundation in both front-end and back-end

        When I'm not coding, you'll find me exploring the latest advancements in AI,
        experimenting with new programming languages, or contributing to open-source
        projects. I'm always eager to learn and take on new challenges in the tech world.
